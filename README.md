## Particle Filter

This is a C++ implementation of a 2 dimensional particle filter. At each time step the filter gets observation and control data and estimates the vehicle position.

See `writeup-report` for more details.


## Dependencies

* cmake >= 3.5
* All other dependencies can be installed by running:
	* install_ubuntu.sh


## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./particle_filter`

**NOTE:** This project is designed to be run against the [Udacity simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases). Run the filter with the simulator already running.


## Examples

A video example is included in `videos` folder.
